      "to this sacred city to express their devotion to God. But just outside\n",
      "the walls of Jerusalem lies the Valley of Hinnom, an ancient place\n",
      "of unholy worship where evil deeds\n",
      "were performed long ago in honor of God's enemy, Satan. In the book of Jeremiah,\n",
      "God reports, through His prophet,\n",
      "that people outside Jerusalem in a place called\n",
      "the Valley of Hinnom, are sacrificing their sons,\n",
      "and also their daughters. And God explicitly says,\n",
      "\"I never asked you to do this satanic ritual,\" and expresses that He's angry, that there's going to be\n",
      "a terrible punishment for this. Historically speaking,\n",
      "in the days of the Bible, not everybody was faithful\n",
      "to the Lord. Satanism influenced\n",
      "the Israelite community. And what they would do,\n",
      "literally, was they'd create\n",
      "a big pit of fire, and they actually\n",
      "would sacrifice their firstborn male\n",
      "through the fire. This was performed\n",
      "in the Valley of Hinnom, which is actually the Hebrew\n",
      "word today for \"hell.\" I can't imagine\n",
      "what would cause someone to want to sacrifice\n",

      "What can explain\n",
      "the shocking events that took place\n",
      "in the Valley of Hinnom thousands of years ago? Was it simply the result\n",
      "of human wickedness? Or is it possible that, as\n",
      "the biblical accounts suggest, Satan and his demons were\n",
      "and still are real entities that have the power\n",

      "think of Satan as Beelzebub or Lucifer\n",
      "or the Prince of Darkness or \"the evil one\" or Old Nick. And some of these names\n",
      "come from scripture. A lot of them\n",
      "come from folklore. And if you think of Satan\n",
      "as this ubiquitous figure who's constantly tormenting\n",
      "and tempting people, then it makes sense\n",
      "that the Devil can be known by all of these\n",

      "Throughout history,\n",
      "many religions have interpreted the world\n",
      "through the lens of having a figure of evil, Satan,\n",
      "who is responsible for evil in the world. According\n",
      "to Christian tradition, Satan was one\n",
      "of the most powerful and beautiful of the angels. He rebelled against God, a third of the angels\n",
      "sided with Satan, and there was a war in heaven. Satan lost\n",
      "and was cast down into hell. Satan is the embodiment of evil, a fallen angel who tempts you\n",
      "to not follow your best values. He is a god of sorts and he can\n",
      "offer something like that to us, great knowledge,\n",
      "control, mastery. The stuff of transcendence. Of course,\n",
      "it will cost us everything. After all, this is not\n",
      "a straight shooter. This is not somebody\n",
      "who's going to tell the truth. His job is to tempt you. CHRIS BADER:\n",
      "Satan is believed to have\n",
      "tried to tempt Jesus when he was in the desert with\n",
      "visions of earthly delights. So Satan is continually,\n",
      "throughout the Bible, someone trying to draw people\n",
      "from God to evil. But the idea of Satan\n",
      "flows throughout history and across religions. There is Mara in Buddhism,\n",
      "who is a demonic king, a entity representing evil,\n",
      "and therefore, would tend to take on\n",
      "very frightening forms which oftentimes are mixtures\n",
      "of human and animal. There is Iblis, who is the\n",
      "Islamic representation of Satan. So, we see this figure of Satan,\n",
      "a singular entity that is in charge of evil\n",
      "across religions and over time. BROCK:\n",
      "In Western Europe,\n",
      "we start to see depictions of the Devil around\n",
      "the eighth and ninth century. And the Devil becomes\n",
      "depicted all over churches, in various other sorts of art\n",
      "and statue and so forth. He is always portrayed\n",
      "as a monstrous beast, half human, half animal,\n",
      "sometimes winged, sometimes horned,\n",
      "sometimes red, sometimes black, occasionally surrounded\n",
      "by his subordinate demons, and often emerging\n",

      "Thousands of Christians\n",
      "are gathered in Saint Peter's Square to watch Pope Francis\n",
      "perform Sunday mass. As he greets the crowd,\n",
      "the pope lays his hands on the forehead of a man\n",

      "went viral, and left many viewers\n",

      "Pope Francis believes in evil spirits,\n",
      "he believes in Satan, he believes in the possibility\n",
      "of possession and the need for exorcists. He's quite traditional\n",
      "in that respect. Exorcisms appear in the oldest\n",
      "writings that we have. From the ancient Near East,\n",
      "from India, from China. So exorcism is literally\n",
      "as old as recorded history. There's many different forms\n",
      "of exorcism all over the world and in different religions, and most have\n",
      "various types of objects that are used to drive\n",
      "away unwanted spirits. Holy relics, crosses,\n",
      "uh, holy water, and even exorcism itself\n",
      "are what the Catholic Church called sacramentals. So, the church's view is that\n",
      "these are symbolic expressions of the authority of the Church. And so, even though they are,\n",
      "in a sense, symbolic, at the same time,\n",
      "they have real power... ...and can help a priest\n",
      "to display the authority of the Church\n",
      "and drive away demons. SHATNER:\n",
      "If Satan and his army of demons are really waging a war\n",
      "against humanity, then exorcists\n",
      "are on the front lines. It's important to realize\n",
      "that an exorcism is not magic. W-We don't do magic. It's a prayer, essentially. It's the Church's prayer\n",
      "to God and Jesus to cast out the demons. And so we invoke that authority as his disciples\n",
      "to cast out the demons. And then we use\n",
      "the Church's prayer called the Rite of Exorcism. We use holy objects\n",
      "like Rosary beads, holy water, crucifixes,\n",
      "any holy object, uh, Satan can't stand it. When the person is manifesting\n",
      "a demonic presence, The first thing\n",
      "that happens is... you've got this\n",
      "incredibly evil look. As a matter of fact, they'll\n",
      "look at me and they'll say, \"You stupid priest.\" If you've ever really looked\n",
      "into the eyes of evil, you won't forget it. And then different things\n",
      "happen which are physically not explainable. A 110-pound young woman throwing three big guys\n",
      "around the room. So we've had some\n",
      "of those sorts of things. A couple teams in the country\n",
      "have had people levitate. We-we haven't. Uh, so there are--\n",
      "things do happen like that. SHATNER:\n",
      "Levitation? It's one thing\n",
      "to believe that Satan can take control\n",
      "of a person's mind or even attack their body. But floating in midair? Is such an extraordinary\n",
      "phenomenon even possible? About 35, you know,\n",
      "salt of the earth people have told me they have\n",
      "witnessed, during a possession, a levitation. It's widely believed\n",
      "in these circles one of the paranormal things\n",
      "that demons can exhibit is getting their possessed\n",
      "victim to levitate. A lot of people challenge\n",
      "what I say, and they say, \"Well, okay,\n",
      "you believe in levitation, which is against\n",
      "the laws of science.\" Of course it's against\n",
      "the laws of normal science. I understand that, you know. I'm not saying\n",
      "I don't believe in gravity. What I'm saying is\n",
      "there are spiritual forces, including dark forces, that can violate\n",
      "the-the normal laws of nature. SHATNER:\n",
      "To some, the stories\n",
      "about the power of exorcism may seem far-fetched. But on the other hand,\n",
      "this practice of banishing evil has offered spiritual relief to people\n",
      "from all walks of life. In most of the cases\n",
      "that we have, the people are very\n",
      "psychologically balanced. We have professional people.\n",
      "We have lawyers. We have military people. We usually heal on both tracks\n",
      "at the same time. We heal on the spiritual level. We also heal\n",
      "the psychological level. Many times,\n",
      "we find that the demonic feeds off the internal wounds,\n",
      "the angers, the unforgiveness, the hurts. So when you start healing\n",
      "some of those inner wounds, they have less to feed off\n",
      "and grab onto. SHATNER:\n",
      "It rises from the earth\n",
      "like a giant fist, stretching out\n",
      "to strike the sky. A colossal, 900-foot shaft\n",
      "of rugged rock, one whose very name\n",
      "conjures notions of both awe and dread. Devils Tower. Devils Tower is remarkable\n",
      "because you can drive across the sedimentary plains,\n",
      "see nothing but flat ground for miles and miles, and then this tall,\n",
      "dark tower emerges as you drive towards it. There is nothing like it\n",
      "in the surrounding area. The rock has a grayish,\n",
      "even a greenish-gray color. And so, as you approach\n",
      "Devils Tower, it's a distinct, stark contrast\n",
      "to the sort of tans and browns of the surrounding\n",
      "sedimentary rocks. SHATNER:\n",
      "Located in northeastern Wyoming, Devils Tower was declared\n",
      "America's very first national monument in 1906\n",
      "by President Theodore Roosevelt, who sought to protect it as an\n",
      "object of scientific interest. Since then, many have asked: what could have caused\n",
      "this massive tower to form? There are many theories\n",
      "about it, but there's no agreement\n",
      "on what it was that produced\n",
      "this miracle of nature. It's made of volcanic-type\n",
      "materials, but there's no other\n",
      "volcanic activity around it. So what caused this thing? We don't know the answer\n",
      "to that question. It's a really interesting\n",
      "conundrum. SHATNER:\n",
      "Is Devils Tower really\n",
      "a miracle of nature? Something that simply\n",
      "cannot be explained by natural and scientific laws? Sorry, but that explanation\n",
      "is simply not good enough. As much as we like to walk\n",
      "around with the confidence that we know this planet and we understand\n",
      "the planet we live on, there seems to be nothing\n",
      "but mystery on this planet. We don't understand\n",
      "how to predict earthquakes. (rumbling) We don't understand\n",
      "how lightning travels. There's so many questions\n",
      "that we have about what produces\n",
      "the forces of nature. SHATNER:\n",
      "Some have suggested that the key\n",
      "to understanding Devils Tower is to think of it the way\n",
      "many Native Americans do: not as a natural formation, but as an unnatural one. The native peoples of the area\n",
      "have worshiped this tower as an altar of sorts, and many feel like they can\n",
      "climb to the top of this place and get divine inspiration, uh,\n",
      "become empowered. And the question is, is there\n",
      "some truth to this native legend that this place is a\n",
      "sacred place on the planet and it is a sort of altar that\n",
      "allows humans to communicate to the spirits\n",
      "or to the universe or to the gods\n",
      "that they believe in? To view Devils Tower,\n",
      "if you want to call it that-- Mathó Thípila\n",
      "is what we call it-- it's a sacred place, and when you see it\n",
      "from a certain distance, even then, you start to feel\n",
      "the wonder of it, the sacredness of it, and as you\n",
      "get closer and closer, the positive sacred energy\n",
      "starts to build, and you feel it\n",
      "even more when you get to the base of the tower. I think, in the case\n",
      "of Devils Tower, it is so unusual,\n",
      "it is so anomalous, that it is easy to ascribe\n",
      "a mystical or spiritual attribute to it. It's not surprising\n",
      "that Hollywood directors would choose this as the place that aliens would land\n",
      "from outer space. In the mid-1970s,\n",
      "one of the most important events in the history of, uh,\n",
      "Devils Tower took place, and that was the filming\n",
      "of the movie  Close Encounters\n",
      " of the Third Kind. In that movie\n",
      "by Steven Spielberg, the tower is a spot that\n",
      "many people are drawn to, and they don't know why\n",
      "they're drawn to it. They're drawn to it\n",
      "from all over the country. It turns out,\n",
      "as the movie goes on, that they're drawn here\n",
      "because they've been abducted some time during their life\n",
      "by aliens. A UFO lands on top of the tower, and Richard Dreyfuss\n",
      "and several other people climb into the UFO\n",
      "and fly off into space. The number of visitors\n",
      "that came to the tower doubled the year after\n",
      "that movie came out, and it stayed at that level\n",
      "every year ever since. I don't know if it's\n",
      "a landing site for UFOs, as Spielberg had in his movie, or what it might be. I mean, the more we look at it,\n",
      "the more baffled we are. We are going to find things\n",
      "as we continue to observe and search and study\n",
      "the Earth that we had no idea how they got there, what type of\n",
      "physical process created them, and we're gonna learn\n",
      "new things all the time. SHATNER:\n",
      "Is it Devils Tower\n",
      "that is unnatural, or is it our own limited\n",
      "understanding of nature that produces the confusion? Perhaps Devils Tower exists\n",
      "to keep mankind humble, as a reminder that we still have\n",
      "a lot to learn. In southern New Jersey,\n",
      "a vast sea of trees stretches as far\n",
      "as the eye can see. Below the dense canopy of these\n",
      "woods lies a primeval world filled with ominous\n",
      "sights and sounds that are shrouded\n",
      "by dark undergrowth. This foreboding wilderness\n",
      "is known as the Pine Barrens. The Pine Barrens is basically\n",
      "a million acres of woodland in the southern tip\n",
      "of New Jersey. You can essentially get lost\n",
      "in the Pine Barrens and never be seen again because they are just so vast. At nighttime, you can hear\n",
      "animals crunching all around. But the problem is you can't\n",
      "see where these things are. It's a terrifying place. And it's very, very scary, especially if you're\n",
      "lost there by yourself. (owl hoots) SHATNER:\n",
      "The Pine Barrens is home\n",
      "to over 500 animal species. But according to locals,\n",
      "there is one creature said to dwell here that has yet\n",
      "to be officially identified. It's a grotesque,\n",
      "winged monster that is known as the Jersey Devil. The New Jersey Devil\n",
      "legend is ingrained into the state\n",
      "of New Jersey so much. It's something that every kid\n",
      "hears when they're growing up. The Jersey Devil's\n",
      "gonna come and get you. One of the most famous aspects\n",
      "of the Jersey Devil is its horrific screech or roar. (creature screeches) If you hear something like that\n",
      "in the Pine Barrens, you run. (creature screeches) CHAD LEWIS:\n",
      "The Jersey Devil looks like\n",
      "it should have come out of Dr. Frankenstein's lab. It's a hodgepodge\n",
      "of animal parts. It has a horse's head\n",
      "with horns growing out of it, a long dragon or kangaroo body, ending in thin, long\n",
      "bird legs and hooves, a forked tail on its back. It has giant leather\n",
      "bat-like wings on its back. If you were to describe\n",
      "something out of a nightmare, the Jersey Devil\n",
      "would be that description. SHATNER:\n",
      "Could a winged abomination really lurk somewhere\n",
      "in the Pine Barrens? Perhaps clues can be found\n",
      "by examining the origin story of this fearsome monster\n",
      "that has been spoken of in local lore\n",
      "for more than 250 years. (creature screeches) SHATNER:\n",
      "As the story goes, in 1735, inside a small house\n",
      "in Leeds Point, New Jersey, a woman gave birth\n",
      "to her unlucky 13th child. And when it was born,\n",
      "it became a monster. According to tradition,\n",
      "the Jersey Devil is actually the 13th child of a woman known\n",
      "as Mother Leeds. And she is on record\n",
      "as having 12 children. So, the story that we get\n",
      "is that, when Mother Leeds was giving birth\n",
      "to this purported 13th child, she apparently, legend says, cried out,\n",
      "\"The devil can take this one.\" And she initially gave birth to a healthy, happy baby boy, who almost immediately\n",
      "transformed into this demon-like creature. (creature screeches) Some stories say\n",
      "that Mother Leeds was killed after the baby was born,\n",
      "by the baby. Other stories just say\n",
      "he flew up the chimney and into the Pine Barrens. SHATNER:\n",
      "Skeptics are quick to dismiss\n",
      "the story of a devil born of human flesh,\n",
      "but after this alleged event, entirely new tales\n",
      "of the monster started to surface\n",
      "in South Jersey. ...in the early 1800s, a military officer\n",
      "of great distinction was said to have had\n",
      "a firsthand encounter with the Jersey Devil. The Jersey Devil has had\n",
      "run-ins with many famous people over the years, such as\n",
      "Commodore Stephen Decatur. He was a famous naval war hero, and he came across\n",
      "the Jersey Devil flying overhead. He fired a cannon\n",
      "at the Jersey Devil. And, according to\n",
      "some eyewitnesses, he shot a hole\n",
      "through one of its wings, but it just flew away\n",
      "like nothing had happened. McNEILL:\n",
      "Naval Commodore Stephen Decatur\n",
      "spoke openly about this. So, when a prominent person\n",
      "comes forward to say, \"Oh, no, absolutely, I saw this,\n",
      "you know, strange horse-faced, winged, dragon-like creature,\n",
      "and I shot a cannonball at it,\" that impresses itself upon us\n",
      "in a way that kind of says, \"Wait a minute, okay.\" The pattern of belief here\n",
      "is so consistent. SHATNER:\n",
      "By the turn of the 20th century,\n",
      "belief in the existence of the Jersey Devil had\n",
      "long been part of local culture. But then, during the week\n",
      "of January 16, 1909, an unprecedented avalanche\n",
      "of Jersey Devil sightings surfaced in the\n",
      "numerous communities bordering the Pine Barrens. And for the first time,\n",
      "this demonic creature terrified not just the residents\n",
      "of New Jersey but also newspaper readers\n",
      "across the United States. 1909 is really a key year for the Jersey Devil story because what we see happen is really what amounts to just an absolute panic. There starts to be report after report after report of people encountering\n",
      "the Jersey Devil, shooting at it... ...seeing its hoofprints\n",
      "on top of their chicken coops and their farm buildings. People are sheltering in place because of the Jersey Devil. One of the more dramatic\n",
      "sightings involved a trolley car\n",
      "in Haddon Heights, New Jersey that was allegedly dive-bombed\n",
      "by the creature. When accounts of these\n",
      "Jersey Devil sightings and attacks surfaced\n",
      "in local newspapers, it actually caused\n",
      "mass hysteria. Local businesses and schools\n",
      "were shut down. The Philadelphia Zoo\n",

      "'The Holy Land. For thousands of years,\\nreligious pilgrims of many faiths have come\\nto this sacred city to express their devotion to God. But just outside\\nthe walls of Jerusalem lies the Valley of Hinnom, an ancient place\\nof unholy worship where evil deeds\\nwere performed long ago in honor of God\\'s enemy, Satan. In the book of Jeremiah,\\nGod reports, through His prophet,\\nthat people outside Jerusalem in a place called\\nthe Valley of Hinnom, are sacrificing their sons,\\nand also their daughters. And God explicitly says,\\n\"I never asked you to do this satanic ritual,\" and expresses that He\\'s angry, that there\\'s going to be\\na terrible punishment for this. Historically speaking,\\nin the days of the Bible, not everybody was faithful\\nto the Lord. Satanism influenced\\nthe Israelite community. And what they would do,\\nliterally, was they\\'d create\\na big pit of fire, and they actually\\nwould sacrifice their firstborn male\\nthrough the fire. This was performed\\nin the Valley of Hinnom, which is actually the Hebrew\\nword today for \"hell.\" I can\\'t imagine\\nwhat would cause someone to want to sacrifice\\ntheir own child, to anything, for-for any reason. But this demonstrates how, in antiquity, people believed\\nthat their crops wouldn\\'t grow, that the rains wouldn\\'t come\\nif they didn\\'t offer sacrifices up to some satanic demons,\\nspirits, whatever. And now you have introduced\\nthis new being that\\'s responsible\\nfor the bad things, and his name comes to be Satan. SHATNER:\\nWhat can explain\\nthe shocking events that took place\\nin the Valley of Hinnom thousands of years ago? Was it simply the result\\nof human wickedness? Or is it possible that, as\\nthe biblical accounts suggest, Satan and his demons were\\nand still are real entities that have the power\\nto influence people? MIKKI BROCK: Some people\\nthink of Satan as Beelzebub or Lucifer\\nor the Prince of Darkness or \"the evil one\" or Old Nick. And some of these names\\ncome from scripture. A lot of them\\ncome from folklore. And if you think of Satan\\nas this ubiquitous figure who\\'s constantly tormenting\\nand tempting people, then it makes sense\\nthat the Devil can be known by all of these\\ndifferent nicknames. Is there really\\na character of the Satan? Well, the definition of that\\nis going to differ between the major\\nworld religions. But fear of an eternal damnation\\nin the afterlife has always been sufficient\\nto keep people religious, and in line with the beliefs\\nof their religious clerics, who warn them\\nthat failure to comply will lead to an eternity\\nof suffering and damnation. Or in other words, the stories\\nfrom which this developed were to teach moral lessons. LAYCOCK:\\nThroughout history,\\nmany religions have interpreted the world\\nthrough the lens of having a figure of evil, Satan,\\nwho is responsible for evil in the world. According\\nto Christian tradition, Satan was one\\nof the most powerful and beautiful of the angels. He rebelled against God, a third of the angels\\nsided with Satan, and there was a war in heaven. Satan lost\\nand was cast down into hell. Satan is the embodiment of evil, a fallen angel who tempts you\\nto not follow your best values. He is a god of sorts and he can\\noffer something like that to us, great knowledge,\\ncontrol, mastery. The stuff of transcendence. Of course,\\nit will cost us everything. After all, this is not\\na straight shooter. This is not somebody\\nwho\\'s going to tell the truth. His job is to tempt you. CHRIS BADER:\\nSatan is believed to have\\ntried to tempt Jesus when he was in the desert with\\nvisions of earthly delights. So Satan is continually,\\nthroughout the Bible, someone trying to draw people\\nfrom God to evil. But the idea of Satan\\nflows throughout history and across religions. There is Mara in Buddhism,\\nwho is a demonic king, a entity representing evil,\\nand therefore, would tend to take on\\nvery frightening forms which oftentimes are mixtures\\nof human and animal. There is Iblis, who is the\\nIslamic representation of Satan. So, we see this figure of Satan,\\na singular entity that is in charge of evil\\nacross religions and over time. BROCK:\\nIn Western Europe,\\nwe start to see depictions of the Devil around\\nthe eighth and ninth century. And the Devil becomes\\ndepicted all over churches, in various other sorts of art\\nand statue and so forth. He is always portrayed\\nas a monstrous beast, half human, half animal,\\nsometimes winged, sometimes horned,\\nsometimes red, sometimes black, occasionally surrounded\\nby his subordinate demons, and often emerging\\nfrom the flames of hell. SHATNER:\\nThousands of Christians\\nare gathered in Saint Peter\\'s Square to watch Pope Francis\\nperform Sunday mass. As he greets the crowd,\\nthe pope lays his hands on the forehead of a man\\nwho is thought to be possessed and recites a prayer. A video of the incident\\nwent viral, and left many viewers\\nto conclude that they had just\\nwitnessed the pope performing an exorcism. GALLAGHER:\\nPope Francis believes in evil spirits,\\nhe believes in Satan, he believes in the possibility\\nof possession and the need for exorcists. He\\'s quite traditional\\nin that respect. Exorcisms appear in the oldest\\nwritings that we have. From the ancient Near East,\\nfrom India, from China. So exorcism is literally\\nas old as recorded history. There\\'s many different forms\\nof exorcism all over the world and in different religions, and most have\\nvarious types of objects that are used to drive\\naway unwanted spirits. Holy relics, crosses,\\nuh, holy water, and even exorcism itself\\nare what the Catholic Church called sacramentals. So, the church\\'s view is that\\nthese are symbolic expressions of the authority of the Church. And so, even though they are,\\nin a sense, symbolic, at the same time,\\nthey have real power... ...and can help a priest\\nto display the authority of the Church\\nand drive away demons. SHATNER:\\nIf Satan and his army of demons are really waging a war\\nagainst humanity, then exorcists\\nare on the front lines. It\\'s important to realize\\nthat an exorcism is not magic. W-We don\\'t do magic. It\\'s a prayer, essentially. It\\'s the Church\\'s prayer\\nto God and Jesus to cast out the demons. And so we invoke that authority as his disciples\\nto cast out the demons. And then we use\\nthe Church\\'s prayer called the Rite of Exorcism. We use holy objects\\nlike Rosary beads, holy water, crucifixes,\\nany holy object, uh, Satan can\\'t stand it. When the person is manifesting\\na demonic presence, The first thing\\nthat happens is... you\\'ve got this\\nincredibly evil look. As a matter of fact, they\\'ll\\nlook at me and they\\'ll say, \"You stupid priest.\" If you\\'ve ever really looked\\ninto the eyes of evil, you won\\'t forget it. And then different things\\nhappen which are physically not explainable. A 110-pound young woman throwing three big guys\\naround the room. So we\\'ve had some\\nof those sorts of things. A couple teams in the country\\nhave had people levitate. We-we haven\\'t. Uh, so there are--\\nthings do happen like that. SHATNER:\\nLevitation? It\\'s one thing\\nto believe that Satan can take control\\nof a person\\'s mind or even attack their body. But floating in midair? Is such an extraordinary\\nphenomenon even possible? About 35, you know,\\nsalt of the earth people have told me they have\\nwitnessed, during a possession, a levitation. It\\'s widely believed\\nin these circles one of the paranormal things\\nthat demons can exhibit is getting their possessed\\nvictim to levitate. A lot of people challenge\\nwhat I say, and they say, \"Well, okay,\\nyou believe in levitation, which is against\\nthe laws of science.\" Of course it\\'s against\\nthe laws of normal science. I understand that, you know. I\\'m not saying\\nI don\\'t believe in gravity. What I\\'m saying is\\nthere are spiritual forces, including dark forces, that can violate\\nthe-the normal laws of nature. SHATNER:\\nTo some, the stories\\nabout the power of exorcism may seem far-fetched. But on the other hand,\\nthis practice of banishing evil has offered spiritual relief to people\\nfrom all walks of life. In most of the cases\\nthat we have, the people are very\\npsychologically balanced. We have professional people.\\nWe have lawyers. We have military people. We usually heal on both tracks\\nat the same time. We heal on the spiritual level. We also heal\\nthe psychological level. Many times,\\nwe find that the demonic feeds off the internal wounds,\\nthe angers, the unforgiveness, the hurts. So when you start healing\\nsome of those inner wounds, they have less to feed off\\nand grab onto. SHATNER:\\nIt rises from the earth\\nlike a giant fist, stretching out\\nto strike the sky. A colossal, 900-foot shaft\\nof rugged rock, one whose very name\\nconjures notions of both awe and dread. Devils Tower. Devils Tower is remarkable\\nbecause you can drive across the sedimentary plains,\\nsee nothing but flat ground for miles and miles, and then this tall,\\ndark tower emerges as you drive towards it. There is nothing like it\\nin the surrounding area. The rock has a grayish,\\neven a greenish-gray color. And so, as you approach\\nDevils Tower, it\\'s a distinct, stark contrast\\nto the sort of tans and browns of the surrounding\\nsedimentary rocks. SHATNER:\\nLocated in northeastern Wyoming, Devils Tower was declared\\nAmerica\\'s very first national monument in 1906\\nby President Theodore Roosevelt, who sought to protect it as an\\nobject of scientific interest. Since then, many have asked: what could have caused\\nthis massive tower to form? There are many theories\\nabout it, but there\\'s no agreement\\non what it was that produced\\nthis miracle of nature. It\\'s made of volcanic-type\\nmaterials, but there\\'s no other\\nvolcanic activity around it. So what caused this thing? We don\\'t know the answer\\nto that question. It\\'s a really interesting\\nconundrum. SHATNER:\\nIs Devils Tower really\\na miracle of nature? Something that simply\\ncannot be explained by natural and scientific laws? Sorry, but that explanation\\nis simply not good enough. As much as we like to walk\\naround with the confidence that we know this planet and we understand\\nthe planet we live on, there seems to be nothing\\nbut mystery on this planet. We don\\'t understand\\nhow to predict earthquakes. (rumbling) We don\\'t understand\\nhow lightning travels. There\\'s so many questions\\nthat we have about what produces\\nthe forces of nature. SHATNER:\\nSome have suggested that the key\\nto understanding Devils Tower is to think of it the way\\nmany Native Americans do: not as a natural formation, but as an unnatural one. The native peoples of the area\\nhave worshiped this tower as an altar of sorts, and many feel like they can\\nclimb to the top of this place and get divine inspiration, uh,\\nbecome empowered. And the question is, is there\\nsome truth to this native legend that this place is a\\nsacred place on the planet and it is a sort of altar that\\nallows humans to communicate to the spirits\\nor to the universe or to the gods\\nthat they believe in? To view Devils Tower,\\nif you want to call it that-- Mathó Thípila\\nis what we call it-- it\\'s a sacred place, and when you see it\\nfrom a certain distance, even then, you start to feel\\nthe wonder of it, the sacredness of it, and as you\\nget closer and closer, the positive sacred energy\\nstarts to build, and you feel it\\neven more when you get to the base of the tower. I think, in the case\\nof Devils Tower, it is so unusual,\\nit is so anomalous, that it is easy to ascribe\\na mystical or spiritual attribute to it. It\\'s not surprising\\nthat Hollywood directors would choose this as the place that aliens would land\\nfrom outer space. In the mid-1970s,\\none of the most important events in the history of, uh,\\nDevils Tower took place, and that was the filming\\nof the movie  Close Encounters\\n of the Third Kind. In that movie\\nby Steven Spielberg, the tower is a spot that\\nmany people are drawn to, and they don\\'t know why\\nthey\\'re drawn to it. They\\'re drawn to it\\nfrom all over the country. It turns out,\\nas the movie goes on, that they\\'re drawn here\\nbecause they\\'ve been abducted some time during their life\\nby aliens. A UFO lands on top of the tower, and Richard Dreyfuss\\nand several other people climb into the UFO\\nand fly off into space. The number of visitors\\nthat came to the tower doubled the year after\\nthat movie came out, and it stayed at that level\\nevery year ever since. I don\\'t know if it\\'s\\na landing site for UFOs, as Spielberg had in his movie, or what it might be. I mean, the more we look at it,\\nthe more baffled we are. We are going to find things\\nas we continue to observe and search and study\\nthe Earth that we had no idea how they got there, what type of\\nphysical process created them, and we\\'re gonna learn\\nnew things all the time. SHATNER:\\nIs it Devils Tower\\nthat is unnatural, or is it our own limited\\nunderstanding of nature that produces the confusion? Perhaps Devils Tower exists\\nto keep mankind humble, as a reminder that we still have\\na lot to learn. In southern New Jersey,\\na vast sea of trees stretches as far\\nas the eye can see. Below the dense canopy of these\\nwoods lies a primeval world filled with ominous\\nsights and sounds that are shrouded\\nby dark undergrowth. This foreboding wilderness\\nis known as the Pine Barrens. The Pine Barrens is basically\\na million acres of woodland in the southern tip\\nof New Jersey. You can essentially get lost\\nin the Pine Barrens and never be seen again because they are just so vast. At nighttime, you can hear\\nanimals crunching all around. But the problem is you can\\'t\\nsee where these things are. It\\'s a terrifying place. And it\\'s very, very scary, especially if you\\'re\\nlost there by yourself. (owl hoots) SHATNER:\\nThe Pine Barrens is home\\nto over 500 animal species. But according to locals,\\nthere is one creature said to dwell here that has yet\\nto be officially identified. It\\'s a grotesque,\\nwinged monster that is known as the Jersey Devil. The New Jersey Devil\\nlegend is ingrained into the state\\nof New Jersey so much. It\\'s something that every kid\\nhears when they\\'re growing up. The Jersey Devil\\'s\\ngonna come and get you. One of the most famous aspects\\nof the Jersey Devil is its horrific screech or roar. (creature screeches) If you hear something like that\\nin the Pine Barrens, you run. (creature screeches) CHAD LEWIS:\\nThe Jersey Devil looks like\\nit should have come out of Dr. Frankenstein\\'s lab. It\\'s a hodgepodge\\nof animal parts. It has a horse\\'s head\\nwith horns growing out of it, a long dragon or kangaroo body, ending in thin, long\\nbird legs and hooves, a forked tail on its back. It has giant leather\\nbat-like wings on its back. If you were to describe\\nsomething out of a nightmare, the Jersey Devil\\nwould be that description. SHATNER:\\nCould a winged abomination really lurk somewhere\\nin the Pine Barrens? Perhaps clues can be found\\nby examining the origin story of this fearsome monster\\nthat has been spoken of in local lore\\nfor more than 250 years. (creature screeches) SHATNER:\\nAs the story goes, in 1735, inside a small house\\nin Leeds Point, New Jersey, a woman gave birth\\nto her unlucky 13th child. And when it was born,\\nit became a monster. According to tradition,\\nthe Jersey Devil is actually the 13th child of a woman known\\nas Mother Leeds. And she is on record\\nas having 12 children. So, the story that we get\\nis that, when Mother Leeds was giving birth\\nto this purported 13th child, she apparently, legend says, cried out,\\n\"The devil can take this one.\" And she initially gave birth to a healthy, happy baby boy, who almost immediately\\ntransformed into this demon-like creature. (creature screeches) Some stories say\\nthat Mother Leeds was killed after the baby was born,\\nby the baby. Other stories just say\\nhe flew up the chimney and into the Pine Barrens. SHATNER:\\nSkeptics are quick to dismiss\\nthe story of a devil born of human flesh,\\nbut after this alleged event, entirely new tales\\nof the monster started to surface\\nin South Jersey. ...in the early 1800s, a military officer\\nof great distinction was said to have had\\na firsthand encounter with the Jersey Devil. The Jersey Devil has had\\nrun-ins with many famous people over the years, such as\\nCommodore Stephen Decatur. He was a famous naval war hero, and he came across\\nthe Jersey Devil flying overhead. He fired a cannon\\nat the Jersey Devil. And, according to\\nsome eyewitnesses, he shot a hole\\nthrough one of its wings, but it just flew away\\nlike nothing had happened. McNEILL:\\nNaval Commodore Stephen Decatur\\nspoke openly about this. So, when a prominent person\\ncomes forward to say, \"Oh, no, absolutely, I saw this,\\nyou know, strange horse-faced, winged, dragon-like creature,\\nand I shot a cannonball at it,\" that impresses itself upon us\\nin a way that kind of says, \"Wait a minute, okay.\" The pattern of belief here\\nis so consistent. SHATNER:\\nBy the turn of the 20th century,\\nbelief in the existence of the Jersey Devil had\\nlong been part of local culture. But then, during the week\\nof January 16, 1909, an unprecedented avalanche\\nof Jersey Devil sightings surfaced in the\\nnumerous communities bordering the Pine Barrens. And for the first time,\\nthis demonic creature terrified not just the residents\\nof New Jersey but also newspaper readers\\nacross the United States. 1909 is really a key year for the Jersey Devil story because what we see happen is really what amounts to just an absolute panic. There starts to be report after report after report of people encountering\\nthe Jersey Devil, shooting at it... ...seeing its hoofprints\\non top of their chicken coops and their farm buildings. People are sheltering in place because of the Jersey Devil. One of the more dramatic\\nsightings involved a trolley car\\nin Haddon Heights, New Jersey that was allegedly dive-bombed\\nby the creature. When accounts of these\\nJersey Devil sightings and attacks surfaced\\nin local newspapers, it actually caused\\nmass hysteria. Local businesses and schools\\nwere shut down. The Philadelphia Zoo\\noffered a reward of $10,000 for the creature\\'s capture, and vigilance committees\\nand posses were formed to hunt the creature. HEIMBUCH:\\nI do think because of the\\nsheer amounts of accounts that happened in 1909, of course some of them are\\nnot gonna be true. Absolutely. But the fact that so many\\nof them happened, I really believe\\nthat there were some actual Jersey Devil encounters\\nduring this time. SHATNER:\\nThe panic of 1909 immortalized the Jersey Devil in both national\\nand local history. But curiously,\\nNative American lore suggests that the origins of this\\nPine Barrens monster may actually go back much\\nfurther into the distant past. In this part of the world,\\nbefore the arrival of colonists, the tribes that lived here\\nwere the Lenape, and they referred to this part\\nof the world-- the Pine Barrens of what is now New Jersey--\\nas \"the place of the dragon.\" So, the presence of a creature in this place of the dragon has been recorded\\nlong into the past. We really do see two different\\ncultural understandings of this place coming together in the idea that\\nthere\\'s a creature here that maybe looks\\na little bit like a dragon.'\n"
